/*
 * Vencord Clipper - the process that actually talks to SteamVR
 *
 * OpenVR is a C API in a DLL, and there is no way to reach one of those from
 * Node without a compiled addon. Shipping a compiled addon means shipping a
 * binary per platform, and a Vencord plugin is source that the person installing
 * it builds themselves - so that was never going to work either.
 *
 * What is already on every Windows machine that could be running SteamVR is a
 * C# compiler, sitting inside PowerShell. So the bridge is a PowerShell script
 * that compiles the C# below on first run and executes it, and the plugin talks
 * to it over its standard input and output, one JSON object per line. No
 * toolchain to install, no binary to trust, and the whole thing is a text file
 * the user can read.
 *
 * The awkward part of OpenVR from a language without a header is that only six
 * functions are exported from the DLL. Everything else is reached through
 * `VR_GetGenericInterface`, which hands back a pointer to a struct of function
 * pointers - so calling one means knowing its index in that struct, counted from
 * the header. Those indices are written down at each call site below, and the
 * whole scheme is checked once at startup by calling `GetRuntimeVersion`, which
 * is the last useful entry in the largest of the tables: if the count is wrong
 * anywhere, that call comes back as nonsense rather than a version number, and
 * the bridge says so instead of carrying on into somebody else's function.
 *
 * The interface versions are pinned on purpose. SteamVR keeps shims for older
 * versions around for ever, so asking for the one this file was written against
 * keeps working as SteamVR moves on, and fails loudly and immediately on a
 * SteamVR too old to have it - which is the correct answer, and much better than
 * silently getting a table laid out differently than expected.
 *
 * Three of the four interfaces are what the binds are made of and the bridge is
 * worth nothing without them. The fourth is the overlay, which is only the panel
 * drawn in front of the player, so a SteamVR without it warns and carries on
 * with the buttons working. That table gets a check of its own before anything
 * is created on it, for the same reason as the version call: asking it to name
 * error zero and getting "VROverlayError_None" back says the entries are where
 * the header says, without calling anything that could turn out to be a
 * different function taking different arguments.
 *
 * Written to C# 4: PowerShell 5.1 compiles with the .NET Framework compiler, and
 * anything newer than that will not build on a stock Windows install.
 *
 * One of these runs for as long as the setting is on, attached or not. SteamVR
 * is off most of the time, and an earlier version of this exited whenever it
 * could not attach and was started again fifteen seconds later - which meant
 * compiling the C# below, from cold, four times a minute, for as long as
 * somebody left Discord open. So the waiting lives in here instead: a failed
 * attach costs one function call and a sleeping thread, and taking a headset
 * off and putting it back on does not start anything at all.
